# Blender Multi-location Project Saver

A Python script that enables users to save Blender projects in multiple locations simultaneously. This feature is currently not provided by Blender tools by default, so this script helps streamline the backup and version control process.

## Features

- Save your Blender project to multiple directories with a single command.
- Automate project backups to external drives or cloud storage locations.
- Maintain version control by saving different copies across different paths.
- Easy to customize and integrate with your current Blender workflow.

## Requirements

- Blender 2.8 or higher
- Python 3.x (comes pre-installed with Blender)
